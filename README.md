# Deep-Learning--Audio-Classifier

The "Audio Classification Project Using Deep Learning" is an innovative application built using TensorFlow and the UrbanSound dataset. 

This project harnesses the power of deep learning to automatically classify various audio sounds. By training a neural network on a diverse range of sound samples, the model gains the ability to recognize and differentiate between different sound classes. 

Through this process, the project enables accurate and efficient identification of sounds, allowing users to obtain meaningful insights into the types of sounds present in audio recordings. 

Also offers a practical way to analyze audio data and provide valuable outputs based on the detected sounds in various application like Environmental Conservation, Security and Surveillance, and Voice Assistants.
